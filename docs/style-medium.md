# Blog Writing Style Notes (medium reasoning)

These notes summarize the writing voice, structure, and patterns from the existing posts in `_posts/`.

## Voice and tone
- Clear, pragmatic, and mildly conversational. The narrator often says what they noticed or thought ("Strange," I thought...).
- Friendly, helpful, and low-ego; the author is comfortable admitting gaps and learning along the way.
- Slightly nerdy with light humor or self-deprecation ("nerd sniped", "pounding the table at 3 am").
- Prefers simple, direct sentences. Avoids flowery language.
- Uses asides and parenthetical clarifications to add nuance without derailing.

## Structure and flow
- Often starts with **TL;DR** for quick value (especially in technical tips).
- Opens with motivation or story: a real problem at work, a browsing anecdote, or a practical need.
- Breaks content into numbered sections or clear headings ("Reason 1", "The math", "Loose ends").
- Uses concrete examples early: code blocks, terminal output, logs, or screenshots.
- Ends with a short reflection or takeaway, then a "Discussion" section with HN link.

## Content style
- Practical, step-by-step guidance with headings, bullets, and short paragraphs.
- Explains "why" after showing "what" (e.g., show command/output, then dig into reasoning).
- Uses precise technical language and correct terms; avoids jargon without definition.
- Includes references and links for further reading, often inline.
- When exploring a deep technical rabbit hole, documents the path with evidence (commands, numbers, formulas).

## Formatting patterns
- Headings are short and descriptive; sections sometimes numbered.
- Code blocks are common, sometimes with language tags.
- When explaining commands, uses short bullet or numbered lists to break steps down.
- Uses inline emphasis sparingly, mostly to stress a key result.
- Includes "Discussion" at end; some posts include "TL;DR" at top.

## Typical rhetorical moves
- Start with a real-world trigger: a personal need or curiosity.
- Provide a quick answer (TL;DR), then expand with details.
- Validate claims with a concrete experiment or calculation.
- Acknowledge caveats or alternate approaches.
- Close with a small reflection, then point to discussion.

## Lexical and stylistic cues
- Uses "So", "But", "However" to manage flow.
- Frequently uses "I" and "we" (inviting reader along).
- Mix of short and medium-length sentences; rarely very long.
- Uses rhetorical questions occasionally ("Why is that?").
- Prefers concrete verbs: "run", "set", "copy", "filter", "divide".

## Recommended outline template
1. Title (specific problem statement).
2. Optional TL;DR.
3. Motivation / story / problem setup.
4. Walkthrough with concrete examples.
5. Deeper explanation / reasoning.
6. Edge cases or loose ends.
7. Short reflection.
8. "Discussion" link.

## Do/Don’t summary
- Do be concise, practical, and evidence-driven.
- Do show actual code or commands early.
- Do explain reasoning step-by-step with numbers or outputs.
- Do keep a friendly, humble voice.
- Don’t use overly polished marketing tone.
- Don’t overuse emojis or trendy internet slang.
- Don’t skip the motivation; the story matters.
